# GG Writing Prompt

## Introduction
GG Writing Prompt is an online platform that enables avid writers to find inspirations for their next story. 
It takes writing prompt from r/writingprompts and the user are then able to choose which language they want to write it (either Malay, English(default), or French). They story could then be saved by sending and email to themselves and to ggwiritngpromt@gmail.com from the platform.

This project was built to explore React hooks and was built during my time in BrainStation web development diploma..

## Future plan
In the future I would want to add a User + Database so that users could sign up to save their favorite prompts and story. They would then be able to set the stories that they had wrote so that others could read and enjoy them. I would also want to add another page that will show all stories that has been shared by all the users.
