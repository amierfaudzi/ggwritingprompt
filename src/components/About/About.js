            <p>I have always loved to write! The world you can conjure and the possibilities are simply endless.</p>
            <p>Which is what <span>prompted</span> me to work on this project in the first place.</p>
            <p>I've React JS to build this website particularly using hooks and I am proud to say that this website is 100% functional component certified.</p>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>I would want to add some way to save the stories that has been written - either by allowing users to export it as a pdf or save it via a user's profile</p>
            <p>Which leads me to the second functionality I would like to see implemented: user authentication and database</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm Amier and I am currently a Web Dev student at BrainStation</p>
            <p>I love to build stuff, mechanically and digitally</p>
            <p>If you want to connect you can reach me through the indeed or email</p>
        </div>
